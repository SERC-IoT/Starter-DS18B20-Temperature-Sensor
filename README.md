# DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

Code for getting started with a DS18B20 temperature sensor.

![sensor](assets/ds18b20_1.jpg)

The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements in the range -55°C to +125°C. The DS18B20 uses a 1-wire serial protocol. Multiple devices can share the same 1-wire bus as each device has a unique 64-bit serial code. The DS18B20 can be powered by a supply between 3.0V and 5.5V.

(Note, on some devices, pins 1 and 3 are switched.)
